The Original Extension is called [**GraphiTabs**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphitabs/dcfclemgmkccmnpgnldhldjmflphkimp), available via Chrome Web Store.

MindTab's work is based on the GraphiTabs extension, and is currently not released to Chrome Web Store yet because of this issue.

**Please consider to support the ORIGINAL author via [GraphiTabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphitabs/dcfclemgmkccmnpgnldhldjmflphkimp) FIRST,** *(and please try to establish contact if possible)*. Then if you are not satisfied with GraphiTabs, consider switching to MindTabs.
